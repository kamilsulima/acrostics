# acrostics
A collection of Acrostic projects

From wikipedia:
> An acrostic is a poem (or other form of writing) in which the first letter (or syllable, or word) of each line (or paragraph, or other recurring feature in the text) spells out a word, message or the alphabet.

**Note: ** These projects I wanted to make for shiffman's a2z course!
